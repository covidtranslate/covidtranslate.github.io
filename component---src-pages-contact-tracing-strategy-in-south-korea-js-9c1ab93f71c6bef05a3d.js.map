But without\n        such a system set in place, it is difficult to either identify the\n        infected person or the people that have had contact with them. It is\n        also hard to know what specific sites to block off and decontaminate. In\n        this case, a nationwide lockdown and the closing of borders become the\n        only viable method of control.\n      </blockquote>\n    </PostLayout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default ContactTracingStrategy\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
